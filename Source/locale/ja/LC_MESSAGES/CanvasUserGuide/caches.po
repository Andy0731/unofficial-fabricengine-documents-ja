"Caches are special nodes in Canvas. A cache node can be used to avoid "
"computation on the left side of the cache in case nothing has changed. This "
"is useful if you know that certain parts of a graph won't have to be "
"executed again. To add a cache to the graph use the smart search hitting "
":dfn:`TAB` and type :dfn:`cache`."

"The result of a Cache node is immutable. This means that it cannot be "
"changed further down the graph. If you need to change the content of a "
"cache, you need to clone it first. Please be aware that cloning might be an "
"expensive operation, so you should experiment a little bit with caches to "
"see if they make sense in your scenario. To add a clone node to the graph "
"use the smart search hitting :dfn:`TAB` and type :dfn:`clone`."
