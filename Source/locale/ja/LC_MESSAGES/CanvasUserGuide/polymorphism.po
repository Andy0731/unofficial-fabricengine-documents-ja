"Nodes in Canvas can be polymorphic. A polymorphic node supports more than "
"one data type. Polymorphic ports appear black, since they don't have a data "
"type yet. Upon connection the port will change its color and data type."

"connect a polymorphic port to it, you can create full subgraphs which stay "
"polymorphic until they are used for a specific data type."
