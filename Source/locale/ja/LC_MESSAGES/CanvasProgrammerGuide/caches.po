"Caches in Canvas are data points which save a copy of the computed value and"
" refrain from recomputing it if none of the upstream inputs have changed. "
"This is useful for branches in graphs which are expensive to compute."

"Caches return immutable values, since it should not be possible for you to "
"change the content of a reference counted data structure down stream (please"
" see :ref:`canvas-programmer-guide-referencetypes` for more information). If"
" you want to modify the returned value you'll have to use a :dfn:`Clone` "

"Caches are not to be mixed up with :ref:`canvas-programmer-guide-variables`."
" Caches are not guaranteed to be kept in memory. A memory manager might "
"decide to clear them. The assumption is that it's always possible to "
"recompute the cache deterministically. You can not rely on the cache to "
"always be kept around, if you need a guaranteed container please use a "
"variable."

"Any Canvas node supports caching, however for simplicity and visibility "
"we've chosen to expose it to the user as a special node. Essentially that "
"node is just a pass through node which has caching turned on. You can enable"
" caching on your own presets only through the :ref:`canvas-programmer-guide-"
"kl2dfg`, using the :dfn:`dfgPresetCacheRule` doxygen qualifier and choosing "
":dfn:`always` as the value."
