"To discuss blocks in more detail, it helps to be specific about certain "
"terminology.  \"Blocks\" live in graphs and functions, and act as "
"placeholders for graphs provided by instances of the graphs and functions"
" (which are commonly referred to as \"nodes\").  These graphs provided by"
" the instances are called \"Block Instances\". A node will have one block"
" instance for each block in the graph or function that defines the node."
"  There can also be additional block instance exposed through \"nested "
"blocks\", which are described further below."

"You can expose blocks in custom graphs and functions that you use inline "

"To expose a block in a graph, right-click on the graph background and "
"select \"New Block\" from the context menu.  You will be prompted to "
"choose a name for the block.  The block will appear with a block-like "
"shape so it is easily distinguished in the graph."

"It is not possible to create a block within the root graph or within a "
"block instance graph; it is only possible in a subgraph of the root graph"
" or of a block instance graph.  This is because it would not be possible "

"Once the block has been created, you can add ports to the block like you "

"To expose a block inside a custom function, first open the function "
"editor as usual.  Near the top of the editor are a set of tabs: a "
"\"Ports\" tab where the ports can be added, edited, removed and "
"rearranged, and a \"Blocks\" tab where the blocks can be added and "
"removed.  To add a block, go to the \"Blocks\" tab, enter a name for the "
"block and click \"Add Block\".  Once the block is added a new, additional"
" tab will appear for the block where you can add ports to the block; "
"these ports will appear as fixed ports in the block instances."

"A node will have one block instance for each block in the graph or "

"node, the node will also have one block instance for each block defined "
"inside a block instance inside the graph.  This is difficult to "
"understand theoretically, but straightforward in practice: it allows you,"
" for instance, to drop a ``ForLoop`` into the graph, and then put a block"
" into the body of the loop; then this block will result in block "
"instances on nodes backed by the graph.  The following animated GIF shows"
" the process of creating a graph that prints a series of values produced "
"by a nested block inside a ``ForLoop`` preset:"

"Block ports follow the same rules for polymorphism as normal graph and "
"function ports.  The polymorphism matching for types is an operation that"
