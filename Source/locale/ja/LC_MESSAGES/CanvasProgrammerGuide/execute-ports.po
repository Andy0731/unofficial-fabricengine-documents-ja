msgid ""
"Execute ports are a special type of port used to control execution of the"
" graph.  For the most part execute ports and their connections appear "
"like regular ports and connections in Canvas, but their behavior is "
"somewhat different, as described below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:8
msgid ""
"An execute port is a port whose type is the built-in type `Execute`.  The"
" type `Execute` is an empty type and carries no data; however, the core "
"of Fabric Engine looks for ports of type `Execute` and uses them to "
"control how Canvas graphs are executed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:11
msgid "The Implicit Execute Port"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:13
msgid ""
"Every instance node automatically has a port of type `Execute` called "
"`exec`.  This is referred to as the :dfn:`implicit execute port`.  The "
"implicit execute port does not appear alongside regular ports on nodes "
"but rather is accessible through the node header:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:17
msgid ""
"Once connected, the connection will also originate from or connect to the"
" node header:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:21
msgid ""
"The implicit execute port is automatically \"pulled\" by a node before "
"the node is executed.  This allows Canvas programmers to ensure that "
"other nodes that are connected to it will be executed before the node is "
"executed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:26
msgid "Explicit Execute Ports"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:28
msgid ""
"In addition to the implicit execute port, you can add explicit execute "
"ports to a node by simply adding ports of type `Execute`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:32
msgid ""
"In the above example, which is a Canvas function that implements a for "
"loop, the `body` port has type `Execute`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:34
msgid ""
"In order to cause an implicit execute port to be executed, you simply "
"wrap the name of of the port in the `dfgExecute(...)` construct as shown "
"above."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:38
msgid ""
"Note that the `dfgExecute(...)` construct is optional; simply inserting "
"the name of the implicit execute port as an expression will cause it to "
"be executed.  The purpose of this is to allow certain polymorphic nodes "
"such as `Fabric.Core.Control.If` to operate equally well when their ports"
" have execute and non-execute types."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:41
msgid "Connections To and From Execute Ports"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:43
msgid ""
"In addition to connections between ports that both have type `Execute`, "
"it is possible to connect from a port that has a type other than "
"`Execute` to a port of type `Execute`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:47
msgid ""
"Such a connection simply pulls the port in question and discards the "
"result."
msgstr ""

msgid "Multiple Connections to Execute Ports"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:52
msgid ""
"Unlike regular ports, it is possible to have multiple connections to a "
"single execute port:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:56
msgid ""
"In the case of multiple connections, the order in which Canvas \"pulls\" "
"the connected ports is not guaranteed; this is to enable (eventually) "
"parallel evaluation of multiple branches.  If you wish to guarantee "
"sequential evaluation, use one of the Execute.Merge presets."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:60
msgid ""
"It is not currently possible in the Canvas interface to see the order of "
"the connections; therefore it is recommended to lay out the nodes "
"manually in the order of the connections so that it is obvious for "
"someone reading the graph.  This will be fixed in a future version of "
"Fabric."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:63
msgid "Multiple Executions of Execute Ports"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:65
msgid ""
"Unlike regular ports, if an implicit execute port is \"pulled\" multiple "
"times, then it will be evaluated multiple times.  This allows you to "
"create looping-type constructs using execute ports."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:67
msgid ""
"Furthermore, whenever an execute port is pulled it will re-evaluate all "
"the (execute and non-execute) ports behind the execute port.  In "
"contrast, when a regular port is pulled it will only evaluate the ports "
"behind it if they haven't already been evaluated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:69
msgid ""
"It is possible to ensure that (execute and non-execute) ports are only "
"pulled a single time by using a explicit `Cache` node.  Simply put the "
"cache node in front of the nodes that you only want to have evaluated a "
"single time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:71
msgid ""
"All of this is illustrated in the ForLoop.canvas example that ships with "
"Fabric, located at "
":file:`$FABRIC_DIR/Samples/Canvas/ExecutePorts/ForLoop.canvas`.  In this "
"example we use execute ports to execute a collection of nodes as the body"
" of a loop, using a Canvas variable to track the iteration of the loop."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/CanvasProgrammerGuide/execute-ports.rst:75
msgid ""
"This example is meant to serve primarily as an example of how execute "
"ports work; a future version of Fabric will introduce a feature called "
"\"blocks\" that will provide a more natural way of looping over groups of"
" nodes."
