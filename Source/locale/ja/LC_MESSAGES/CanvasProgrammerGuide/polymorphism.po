"Polymorphism in Canvas is implemented as part of the code generation step. "
"Nodes which have polymorphic types are either a) a KL function node which "
"has a port with a polymorphic type specification or b) a subgraph which in "
"turn uses a polymorphic KL function. Polymorphic nodes are versatile "
"utilities which can be used with a variety of data types. It's due to the "
"compiler however to validate if the resulting generated code will work. Thus"
" you CAN CREATE ERRONEOUS GRAPHS using polymorphism."
