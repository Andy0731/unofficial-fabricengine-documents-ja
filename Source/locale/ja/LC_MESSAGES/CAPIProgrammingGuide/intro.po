"The Fabric Core C/C++ API, referred to as :dfn:`CAPI` in this document, is "
"the lowest-level API in the Fabric Platform application stack.  The main "
"purpose of CAPI is to provide the native language layer for the Fabric Core "
"Python bindings; however, a sophisticated Fabric Platform application can "
"interface directly to CAPI if needed."

"CAPI is a direct C- and C++-language interface to Fabric Core.  CAPI fully "
"exposes Fabric Core to a C and C++ language programming environment.  Using "
"CAPI, you can create Fabric Core dependency graphs, load data into the group"
" nodes, perform KL operator evaluations, render results into viewports "
"and/or obtain the results of evaluations for further work.  All the the "
"functionality of Fabric Core is available, including the powerful Fabric "
"Platform extension mechanism.  This guide assumes the reader is already "
"familiar with the main concepts of Fabric Core; complete documentation on "
"all aspects of Fabric Platform and the Fabric Core can be found at "

"CAPI is implemented as a pure C API with a thin, inlined C++ interface that "
"makes it easier to use in C++ applications.  This is done to minimize "
"linking issues, as the C linking interface on the platforms that Fabric "
"Platform supports is much more controlled than the C++ linking interface.  "
"The C++ interface is thus purely a C++ programmer convenience; however, it "
"is a big programmer convenience, and as such it is recommended that you use "
"the C++ language interface when possible.  Both interfaces link with exactly"
" the same shared library (DLL)."
