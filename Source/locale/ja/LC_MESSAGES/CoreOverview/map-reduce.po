"|FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| provides a generic map-reduce framework that can be "
"used to create recursively-parallel operations on large data sets. Map-"
"reduce is an ideal paradigm for solving problems that are solved "
"recursively, or require a reduction step such as counting elements in large "
"data sets."

"The |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| implementation of map-reduce expands on the "
"concepts of the classic map-reduce model, providing a more flexible tool. By"
" allowing the results of a map-reduce call do be used to drive further map-"
"reduce calls, problems that are difficult to parallelize become solvable in "
"this multi-threaded context."
