"|FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| provides a method for defining types that are used in "
"KL operators and dependency graph nodes. Once a custom type is registered, "
"the data type can be used to populate nodes and can be used in KL operators."
"  This type system enables the types used in the KL source code to be "
"defined before compilation."

"Using only a small number of basic atomic types, users can register custom "
"types that combine these types into new complex types. Types can be defined "
"using existing complex types, allowing the definition of complex nested data"
" structures.  Types can have KL functions associated with them, enabling "
"object method syntax to be used with the type in KL."
