"|FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| is a high-performance processing engine that "
"integrates with dynamic languages by exposing an interface for defining "
"multi-threaded native code operations. |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| enables high-"
"performance applications to be built using dynamic languages by providing an"
" environment where processor-intensive tasks can be offloaded and processed "
"using multi-threaded native code."

"|FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| has been designed for developers who are comfortable "
"building tools and services using dynamic languages. Developers working with"
" |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| do not require experience of performance software "
"development, nor do they need knowledge of complex languages such as C++."

"Developers continue to work with the same tools they are already familiar "
"with, and they can run their applications or services in the usual way. "
"Existing applications and services can be modified to incorporate "
"|FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| for handling compute intensive tasks. Since the "
"majority of code in most applications is not performance critical, this code"
" can continue to be written in the developers' preferred language. No custom"
" IDE or compilation tool chain is required as |FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| "
"integrates a compiler and loads source code from text files."

"|FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| is a completely dynamic development environment where "
"all data structures, graph structures, and code are specified at run time. "
"|FABRIC_PRODUCT_NAME| can be integrated with any programming language, and "
"is currently integrated with JavaScript and Python. We will add support for "
"other languages over time."

"This development paradigm significantly lowers the technical level required "
"to write multi-threaded code, and enables a broad range of developers to "
