"Extensions are libraries loaded at initialization time that can define "
"libraries of KL functions and/or bind C++ code libraries and expose their "
"interfaces to KL. The extension system is used to integrate existing "
"libraries of code with Fabric Engine applications. Fabric Engine comes "
"packaged with a wide range of extensions that provide a range of "
"functionality including the Bullet physics library, the OpenCV computer "
"vision library and the Microsoft Kinect SDK."
