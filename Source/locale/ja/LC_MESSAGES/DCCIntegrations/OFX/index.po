"The Splice OFX plugin is shipped as a standard plugin library. In order for "
"a OFX host to properly find the plugin the environment variable "
":envvar:`OFX_PLUGIN_PATH` needs to be set to the parent folder of the "
"install location before the host app is launched. Once in the host app you "
"can should see plugin. Depending on the host app you should then be able to "
"create an effect or a node called \"FabricSplice\". The OFX plugin doesn't "
"support a procedural UI for now, so it's limited to 5 Scalar ports and 5 "
"Color ports. Additionally you will need to set the "
":envvar:`FABRIC_EXTS_PATH` variable to the Exts folder contained in the "
"installer archive. You can find example KL operator to be used in "
"conjunction with the Splice plugin within the :dfn:`samples` folder of the "
"archive."
