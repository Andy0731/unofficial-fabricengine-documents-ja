"This workshop covers the topics of creating procedural geometry in Maya, and"
" continues to describe how tools can be made portable with Splice, moving "
"the procedural geometry from Maya to Softimage, Arnold and Nuke. This "
"workshop targets users with experience in geometry generation, 3D Math and "
"geometry pipeline issues (such as procedural geometry in an offline "
"renderer)."
