"In this workshop you'll learn how to use Splice in Maya to build deformers. "
"The workshop covers everything from a basic wave deformer to a wrap mesh "
"deformer supporting sliding. The workshop picks up topics from the "
":ref:`KLWORKSHOP` and uses PEX for multithreading."

"Unfortunately the PolygonMesh class changed prior to the release, after the "
"workshops were finished. It's a minimal change though. The PolygonMesh no "
"longer provides getAttributes. You can now call on the PolygonMesh itself to"
" perform getOrCreateAttribute. The workshop files on Github below contain a "
"fixed version of these scenes."
