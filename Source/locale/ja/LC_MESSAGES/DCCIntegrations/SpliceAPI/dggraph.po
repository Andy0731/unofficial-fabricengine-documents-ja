"The DGGraph is the dependency graph container in the SPLICECAPI. It hosts KL"
" operators, FabricCore elements such as dependency graph nodes, and provides"
" access to :ref:`dgport` objects. The DGGraph class wraps the functionality "
"of the lower level FabricCore CAPI and provides persistence functionality to"
" store/restore the computation setup to/from files or strings. The class "
"outline can be found further down on this page."
