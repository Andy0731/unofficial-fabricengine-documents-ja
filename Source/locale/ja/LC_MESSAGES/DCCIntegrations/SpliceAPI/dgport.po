"When accessing data on instances of FabricSplice::DGPort, eg. through "
":code:`DGPort::getRTVal()`, it is the responsibility of the client to ensure"
" that accesses to data on the same port are synchronized, ie. that two "
"threads don't try to change the value at the same time.  However, it is safe"
" to access data on different instances of FabricSplice::DFGPort without "
"locking."
