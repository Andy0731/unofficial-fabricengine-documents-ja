"The Splice Splice Arnold procedural is shipped as a standard plugin library."
" In order for Arnold to properly find the plugin you will need to add the "
"installation location to the Arnold :dfn:`procedural_searchpath`. The sample"
" which ships with the installation archive relies on the "
":envvar:`FABRIC_SPLICEARNOLD_ROOT` environment variable to be set. "
"Additionally you will need to set the :envvar:`FABRIC_EXTS_PATH` variable to"
" the Exts folder contained in the installer archive. You can find example KL"
" operator to be used in conjunction with the FabricSplice plugin within the "
":dfn:`samples` folder of the archive. Depending on your operating system it "
"might be required to add the location of the FabricCore-|FABRIC_VERSION| "
"library to your :envvar:`PATH` or the :envvar:`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`."
