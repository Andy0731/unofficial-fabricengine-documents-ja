"Fabric for Maya was built with usability in mind, so rather than providing "
"only the set of APIs for programmers to integrate it in existing DCCs a Maya"
" plugin has also been created for TDs, with a command for scripting as well "
"as a native graphical user interface and OpenGL visual-debugging in the 3D "
"Viewport. The plug-in offers a very tight integration of Canvas inside Maya,"
" allowing TDs to instantiate a custom Maya node or a deformer to "
"subsequently author the contained Canvas graphs, the nodes will operate as "
"standard maya computational units, while Canvas graphs will allow TDs to "
"safely build performance critical code for any kind of purpose, such as "
"rigging, FX simulation or any other kind of heavy data processing."
