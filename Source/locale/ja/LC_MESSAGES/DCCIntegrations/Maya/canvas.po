"By checking the :dfn:`opaque in DCC` checkbox causes Maya to use a special "
"data type for the Maya attribute instead of reflecting it as a native type. "
"These attributes can be connected between each other (from one Maya node to "
"the next) without Maya interpreting the data. This is very useful when "
"passing heavy data around which you don't need access to outside of Canvas, "
"but you still want to pass it between Maya nodes. This is also very useful "
"for passing data between Canvas Maya nodes which Maya is not able to reflect"
