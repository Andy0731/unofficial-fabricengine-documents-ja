"Support for Maya 2016 was first added in Fabric Engine version 2.0.0.  One "
"of the key new features of Maya 2016 is support for parallel evaluation of "
"the Maya node graph.  Fabric for Maya adds user-controlled support for "
"enabling specific nodes to run in parallel when the Maya 2016 parallel "
"evaluation is enabled."

"By default, Canvas and Splice nodes will never run in parallel with each "
"other, even if parallel evaluation is enabled.  This is because Fabric for "
"Maya does not know for sure if it's safe for any two nodes to run at the "
"same time; for instance, if the two nodes use a non-thread-safe KL "
"extension."

"These variables should only be used under very controlled circumstances, as "
"they will cause all user-created Fabric nodes to run in parallel with each "
"other.  If these nodes, even indirectly, write to a common shared resource, "
