"Studios making use of the Fabric Fifty program as well as Commercial and "
"Educational customers will receive an RLM floating license. Floating "
"licenses allow an organization to run an RLM server in a central location "
"and have their users validate licensing against this server rather than "
"requiring each user to have their own license. With floating licenses the "
"server holds a fixed number of licenses and will allow up to that many users"
" to run the software at any given time. The number of actual users may be "
"higher, floating licenses only allow for a fixed number of licenses to be "
"\"checked out\" at any given time. Once a user finishes using the software "
"the license is \"checked in\" again and can be used by someone else. More "
